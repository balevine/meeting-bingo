# Meeting Bingo

Look. I don't like most meetings. You want a status update? Use email.

Unfortunately, lots of people love meetings. And lots of the people who love meetings love to talk. And lots of them love to use lots of the same phrases.

Spice up your meetings with these Meeting Bingo cards. Generate a couple of cards and pass them around before the meeting.

Want to make it useful? Make sure everyone in the meeting has one and the first one to get a Bingo wins a prize (money? candy? a week without meetings?). Incentivize everyone to stop using these terrible phrases. Or maybe incentivize people to have fewer meetings. Either way, I'm sure there's a way to make this useful and not mean.

Circle the wagons and get aligned on this. It's fun for everyone.

## About the script

The phrases are stored in an array in the `/resources/phrases.js` file. If you have some ideas for new phrases to be added, open an issue or pull request.

If you think the site could look better...well, you're right. I just kinda threw it together. Want to make it look nicer? I'm open to help on that if you want to send a pull request. Otherwise, I don't mind the minimalist look, honestly.

## Most importantly

Don't be mean to people. Have fun. And maybe try to have fewer meetings.
